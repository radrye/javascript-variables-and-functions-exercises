Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateAge that:
takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.
Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in. */

    // to do with whatever it's supposed to do..

      var possibleAge1 = currentYear - birthYear;
